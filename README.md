# Cybersecurity Current Event Report

## Broadvoice Data Breach

### What type of attack was this?

Due to a configuration error with their databases, Broadvoice exposed over 350 million customer records which each include a lot of sensitive data, including things such as names, phone numbers, and call transcripts. While this in itself was not officially "discovered" and announced to the public by a malicious user, it certainly could have left the company's databases open to a lot of zero-day attacks if in fact this information was discovered prior and shared around through various means.

### How was the vulnerability discovered?

The vulnerability was discovered by a security consultant by the name of Bob Diachenko in collaboration with Comparitech. 

### How were the attackers able to exploit the vulnerability?

Although it is unclear how exactly attackers were able to exploit this vulnerability, it is true that the vulnerability existed, and that 10 of Broadvoice's databases were exposed and easy to access. Should these databases have in fact granted access to an unauthorized user, it could potentially lead to many problems for Broadvoice's users some time down the line. After all, the data stored in said databases included things such as voicemails with medical outlets and financial services firms, and personally identifiable information, which can be used in a number of ways by a cyber attacker. 

### Were there security measures that could have been taken in order to prevent this attack?

Given the fact that a patch was implemented by Broadvoice with incredible haste, I do believe that there were measures that could have been taken to prevent this attack. I could be wrong because I don't have all of the details on what exactly the configuration error consisted of, but on a surface level it truly seems as though this was something that was simply overlooked for one reason or another, or perhaps even something that was meant to be fixed at an earlier date but then later forgotten about. Of course, this is all speculation, but it stands to reason that a more careful look, or even potentially just peer review of the code which caused this error could have prevented this in the first place. However, even this is easier said than done because it is simply a fact that even the smallest and hardest to find typo in this line of work can spell disaster for an application or company.

## Ukraine Ransomware

### What type of attack was this?

As the title of this section implies, this specific attack was done via ransomware. While Ukraine was certainly hit the hardest according to an anti-virus vendor known as ESET, it also affected 64 countries in total, such as Germany and the US. However, for one reason or another, it should be noted that the percentage of users affected by this attack outside of the Ukraine were drastically lower.

### How was the vulnerability discovered?

It was fairly simple for people to catch on to this vulnerability once their systems started to go down. As a matter of fact, this happened all over the globe as mentioned earlier, but more specific examples of people affected include the company Maersk and a Cadbury's factory on Tasmania. It was all but clear that an attack was happening, but the source of the problem was and still remains slightly unclear.

### How were the attackers able to exploit the vulnerability?

While many people believe that this virus originated after a Ukrainian tax-filing software by the name of MEDoc had their automatic update system hijacked by cyber attackers to download and run the malware instead of a real update, MEDoc denied the claims. Although, if we continue down this line of thinking, this theory does become more and more convincing, especially since there have been experts who back up this claim. They also state that once the virus has breached an organization, it would be very easy to spread the malware to other computers on the same network, thus further endangering company assets.

### Were there security measures that could have been taken in order to prevent this attack?

This is tricky to answer considering the real source of the malware spreading hasn't been 100% confirmed, but if we assume that it was in fact through MEDoc's automatic software updating system, this would have been extremely hard to catch and prevent ahead of time. Users typically rely on the software vendors to have their best interests in mind, and typically don't think twice when it comes to updating their software. Perhaps truly the only people who would have noticed something off would have been the people in charge of setting those updates, although I can think of no way they would have noticed in time if this problem hadn't occurred  in the past. Perhaps just an overall tightening on security and encryption to gain access to those security updates or some such? I can't say that even fully makes sense given my experience, but that is the only thing that comes to mind regarding this issue.
