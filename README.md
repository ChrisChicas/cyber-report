# Cybersecurity Current Event Report

## Broadvoice Data Breach

### What type of attack was this?

Due to a configuration error with their databases, Broadvoice exposed over 350 million customer records which each include a lot of sensitive data, including things such as names, phone numbers, and call transcripts. While this in itself was not officially "discovered" and announced to the public by a malicious user, it certainly could have left the company's databases open to a lot of zero-day attacks if in fact this information was discovered prior and shared around through various means.

### How was the vulnerability discovered?

The vulnerability was discovered by a security consultant by the name of Bob Diachenko in collaboration with Comparitech. 

### How were the attackers able to exploit the vulnerability?

Although it is unclear how exactly attackers were able to exploit this vulnerability, it is true that the vulnerability existed, and that 10 of Broadvoice's databases were exposed and easy to access. Should these databases have in fact granted access to an unauthorized user, it could potentially lead to many problems for Broadvoice's users some time down the line. After all, the data stored in said databases included things such as voicemails with medical outlets and financial services firms, and personally identifiable information, which can be used in a number of ways by a cyber attacker. 

### Were there security measures that could have been taken in order to prevent this attack?

Given the fact that a patch was implemented by Broadvoice with incredible haste, I do believe that there were measures that could have been taken to prevent this attack. I could be wrong because I don't have all of the details on what exactly the configuration error consisted of, but on a surface level it truly seems as though this was something that was simply overlooked for one reason or another, or perhaps even something that was meant to be fixed at an earlier date but then later forgotten about. Of course, this is all speculation, but it stands to reason that a more careful look, or even potentially just peer review of the code which caused this error could have prevented this in the first place. However, even this is easier said than done because it is simply a fact that even the smallest and hardest to find typo in this line of work can spell disaster for an application or company.
